This is the project folder for the paper "The Homogeneous MeerKAT & Swift/XRT Radio:X-ray Plane" (Crook-Mansour et al. 2026)


* 0_UTILITY_FUNCTIONS:
- Contains all the functions/code used in the analysis for this paper. 
- Contains notebooks where I check the functionality of some of this code. 


* 1_SOURCE_CHECKs:
- I plot the results for each source individually, and compare to the relevant observation papers. 

* 2_ALL_LIGHT_CURVES:
- I plot the light curves for all the sources together. 
- I run the code to calculate jet kinetic energy estimates using the light curve data. 

* 3_ALL_LR_LX: 
- I plot the LrLx data for all the sources together. 

* 4_CLUSTERING:
- I run clustering algorithms on the LrLx data for all the sources together. 

* 5_LIN_REG:
- I run linear regression on the LrLx data for all the sources together. 
- I also run linear regression on some of the well-sampled sources. 
- I compare the NS and BH samples. 
- I run the outlier factor analysis work. 

* DATA: 
- Contains the data files for all the sources.
